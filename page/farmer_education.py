    st.markdown("""
    ### How long does it take to improve my credit score?
    It depends on your situation, but you should start seeing improvements in 3-6 months with consistent good practices.
    
    ### Will checking my credit score lower it?
    No, checking your own credit score is considered a "soft inquiry" and doesn't affect your score.
    
    ### Can I get a loan with a low credit score?
    Yes, but you'll likely face higher interest rates or may need to provide more collateral.
    
    ### How often should I check my credit report?
    It's good practice to check your credit report at least once a year, or before applying for any significant loan.
    
    ### Can I build credit without taking loans?
    Yes, through mobile money services, consistent savings with formal institutions, and joining cooperatives with good standing.
